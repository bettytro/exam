This project was an exam at Noroff. It's a website where you can add you venues and people can book the venue if they like it. The project uses the Noroff API v2.

## Description

The homepage has a big hero section which looks really appealing when you open the site, and straight from there you can browse recent venues. On the homepage there is also a grid with venues where you can explore other venues aswell. 

There is also a auth system that lets you register or login, you can also register as a venuemanager so  you can post your own venues. You are also allowed to browse venues, but not book them, if you are not logged in.
